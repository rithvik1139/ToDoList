# ToDoList

Description: 

This is a web application that allows you to add and remove items from a ToDo list. To add an item you simply type in the input field, and to remove an item, click on one of the entries already posted.

How to Run: 

    - go to https://github.com/rithvik1139/ToDoList
    - copy git repository
    - open index.html file in web browser

Future Improvements: 

The next step in this repository would be to add additional functionality to the ToDo list such as the ability to make multiple lists on the same page. Other improvements could include deadlines and alerts/reminders for certain tasks that need to be completed in a time-sensative manner.
